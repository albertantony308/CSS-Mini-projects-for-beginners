       <p> Varshangalkku Shesham movie review: The major disappointment in Vineeth Sreenivasan's Dhyan Sreenivasan and Pranav Mohanlal-starrer lies in the movie.However, what makes Varshangalkku Shesham different from The Archies is its comparatively relatable setting and its ambivalent stance on nepotism. In other words, it can be said that the movie maintains a love-hate relationship with nepotism: while it has been made with the help of the practice, the film’s narrative mocks the same in a “clever” way, which ultimately works in favour of Varshangalkku Shesham, although only to an extent.

Unlike movies like Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback, The Dirty Picture, Heroine et al, Varshangalkku Shesham does not centre on the film industry’s pitfalls. Instead, it focuses on the lives of two aspirants whose professional and personal journeys are shaped by the decisions they make, whether positive or detrimental.

Revolving around two close friends — Venu (Dhyan Sreenivasan) and Murali (Pranav Mohanlal) — the film’s story spans multiple decades, chronicling their lives through different periods. It delves into their evolving bond and the challenges they face in both their personal relationship and professional pursuits as Venu strives to establish himself as a writer-director, while Murali aims to carve a niche as a music composer. Beginning in the 1960s when they meet for the first time, the film follows their journey as they become closer, then relocate to Kodambakkam in Madras to chase their dreams, encounter obstacles, gradually gain recognition, experience success, endure conflicts, drift apart, suffer career setbacks, hit rock bottom, reconcile and ultimately embark on a new chapter together.

Just like Vineeth Sreenivasan’s other films, except for Thira, Varshangalkku Shesham also starts off on a lighter tone, drawing inspiration from the styles of his father Sreenivasan and director Priyadarshan, and includes several scenes aimed at eliciting laughter. Vineeth, as usual, also incorporates elements to evoke nostalgic feelings in the audience, which, combined with Dhyan Sreenivasan’s comedic talent, immediately engages viewers.
